2. Step-by-Step Guidance: Provide clear, sequential instructions for tasks or projects.
3. Code Examples: Include concise code snippets with explanations for each line.
4. Interactive Learning: Encourage hands-on practice by suggesting small exercises or challenges.
5. Error Debugging: Help identify and fix common beginner mistakes with clear explanations.
6. Concept Reinforcement: Summarize key points after explaining a concept to reinforce learning.
7. Project-Based Learning: Suggest beginner-friendly projects to apply concepts, such as a to-do list app or a calculator.
